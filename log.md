# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2, 2024
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I learned a good amount of basic HTML tags, then created a very basic personal page html code using them.

**Thoughts:** Oh my gosh, coding is so much more work than I thought it would be, even with basic things like what I just did. I feel like I'm gonna become a sleep deprived programmer nerd once I'm done with this challenge. Other than that though, this was really exciting but exhausting to do :D

### Day 2: November 3, 2024
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I learned quite a few more HTML tags, like ones that style text, ones that incorporate audios, videos, and forms into my web page. I also worked on a page that has a few ojibwe phrases that are fun to say and listen to. 

**Thoughts:** I'm loving this programming thing so far. I feel challenged, like I'm making progress, like I'm being productive, and like I'm applying my knoweldge :D

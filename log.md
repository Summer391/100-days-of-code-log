# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2, 2024
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I learned a good amount of basic HTML tags, then created a very basic personal page html code using them.

**Thoughts:** Oh my gosh, coding is so much more work than I thought it would be, even with basic things like what I just did. I feel like I'm gonna become a sleep deprived programmer nerd once I'm done with this challenge. Other than that though, this was really exciting but exhausting to do :D

### Day 2: November 3, 2024
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I learned quite a few more HTML tags, like ones that style text, ones that incorporate audios, videos, and forms into my web page. I also worked on a page that has a few ojibwe phrases that are fun to say and listen to. 

**Thoughts:** I'm loving this programming thing so far. I feel challenged, like I'm making progress, like I'm being productive, and like I'm applying my knoweldge :D

### Day 3: November 4, 2024
#####

**Today's Progress**: I finally got a move on with HTML and started learning some basic CSS. I also created a basic stylized quiz page, although I had issues with alignment, so I just did it verically.

**Thoughts:** I can already tell that this is going to be a challenge, as I spent an unbelievable amount of time trying to figure out how to target in CSS properly. I also struggled A LOT with aligning elements the way I wanted, that's definitely something I need to learn, along with just about everything else about CSS (although I do have a few fundamental things in my brain already). I also forgot a lot of html when I was making a basic styled web page, so I should probably be either reviewing it often, or using it more often, creating a wider variety of web pages that solidify my understanding of specific HTML tags. Other than all of that, it feels like another day of succesful coding, feeling challenged, struggling, learning new things, and growth :D
